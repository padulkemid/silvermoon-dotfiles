This is my 2020 Macbook Pro dotfiles, its kinda bit different from my 2015 and
my Arch linux. All of this dotfiles are linked and not intended to place them
straight into their respected config folder ( e.g : `~/.config` ) because the
symlinks all already done.

I will create install script to use this later ( auto-symlink ) and setup. This
would only work on Catalina since Big Sur had a security troubles ( `yabai` is
supported but need several new configs ).
