# 🌙 Silvermoon

this is my current dotfiles, its kinda bit different from my old one,
and my Artix. all of this dotfiles are linked and not intended to place them
straight into their respected config folder ( e.g : `~/.config` ) because the
symlinks all already done.  

a big note: This config only works in _intel based macs_ not the M one.
